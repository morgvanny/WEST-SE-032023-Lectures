# 3. ‚úÖ Create a Production class that inherits from Resource

# 4. ‚úÖ Create a GET (All) Route
# 4.1 Make a `get` method that takes `self` as a param.
# 4.2 Create a `productions` array.
# 4.3 Make a query for all productions. For each `production`, create a dictionary
# containing all attributes before appending to the `productions` array.
# 4.4 Create a `response` variable and set it to:
#  #make_response(
#       jsonify(productions),
#       200
#  )
# 4.5 Return `response`.
# 4.6 After building the route, run the server and test in the browser.

# 5. ‚úÖ Serialization
# This is great, but there's a cleaner way to do this! Serialization will allow us to easily add our
# associations as well.
# Navigate to `models.py` for Steps 6 - 9.

# 10. ‚úÖ Use our serializer to format our response to be cleaner
# 10.1 Query all of the productions, convert them to a dictionary with `to_dict` before setting them to a list.
# 10.2 Invoke `make_response`, pass it the production list along with a status of 200. Set `make_response` to a
# `response` variable.
# 10.3 Return the `response` variable.
# 10.4 After building the route, run the server and test your results in the browser.

# 11. ‚úÖ Create a POST Route
# Prepare a POST request in Postman. Under the `Body` tab, select `form-data` and fill out the body
# of a production request.

# Create the POST route
# üìö Review With Students: request object

# 11.1 Create a `post` method and pass it `self`.
# 11.2 Create a new production from the `request.form` object.
# 11.3 Add and commit the new production.
# 11.4 Convert the new production to a dictionary with `to_dict`
# 11.5 Set `make_response` to a `response` variable and pass it the new production along with a status of 201.
# 11.6 Test the route in Postman.


# 12. ‚úÖ Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`

# 13. ‚úÖ Create a GET (One) route
# 13.1 Build a class called `ProductionByID` that inherits from `Resource`.
# 13.2 Create a `get` method and pass it the id along with `self`. (This is how we will gain access to
# the id from our request)
# 13.3 Make a query for our production by the `id` and build a `response` to send to the browser.


# 14. ‚úÖ Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`
